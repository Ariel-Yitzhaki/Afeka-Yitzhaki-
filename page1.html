    <p>The Eiffel Tower is an iconic iron lattice tower located in Paris, France.
        Built in 1889 for the World's Fair, it stands 330 meters tall and was designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel.
        Originally criticized by Parisians, it has become one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world and a
        symbol of France.
        The tower features three levels accessible to visitors, offering panoramic views of Paris.
        It attracts millions of tourists annually and is illuminated with thousands of lights each evening, creating a
        spectacular nighttime display.</p>
