    <p>The Old City of Jerusalem is a historic walled area within modern Jerusalem,
        containing sites of immense religious and cultural significance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
        Divided into four quarters—Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Armenian—the Old City spans just one square
        kilometer but holds thousands of years of history. Key landmarks include the Western Wall, the Church of the
        Holy Sepulchre, and the Dome of the Rock. The ancient stone walls and narrow alleyways create a unique
        atmosphere where different cultures and religions coexist. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Old
        City attracts millions of pilgrims and tourists annually who come to experience its sacred sites, bustling
        markets, and rich archaeological heritage.</p>
