    <p>Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock tower at the Palace of
        Westminster in London, England. The tower itself, officially named Elizabeth Tower since 2012, was completed in
        1859 and stands 96 meters
        tall. The clock is renowned for its accuracy and reliability, with its iconic chimes heard across the city.
        Big Ben has become one of London's most famous landmarks and a symbol of British culture and parliamentary
        democracy.
        The Gothic Revival architecture and the distinctive sound of its bells make it one of the most photographed and
        recognizable structures in the world.</p>
