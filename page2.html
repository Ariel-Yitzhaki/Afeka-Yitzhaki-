    <p>Tokyo Tower is a communications and observation tower located in Minato, Tokyo, Japan.
        Completed in 1958, it stands 333 meters tall and was inspired by the Eiffel Tower's design.
        The tower serves as a broadcasting antenna for television and radio stations while also functioning as a major
        tourist attraction.
        Its distinctive orange and white color scheme was chosen to comply with aviation safety regulations.
        Tokyo Tower features two observation decks offering panoramic views of Tokyo and, on clear days, Mount Fuji.
        It has become an iconic symbol of Japan's post-war rebirth and modernization, remaining one of Tokyo's most
        beloved landmarks despite being surpassed in height by newer structures.</p>
